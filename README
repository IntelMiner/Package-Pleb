PACKAGE PLEB

Package Pleb is a really simple (I mean /really/ simple) package manager for Gentoo I wrote in Bash

Actually calling it a package manager is a bit unfair, it simply blindly pulls packages down, hashes and extracts them

Maybe when I stop being such a lazy shit I'll add more features

As for now it's pretty badly written (sed chains, outputting to .txt files instead of using pipes) and lots of commented out functions (mostly to de-fang it for debugging)

Other than that it's (I think) fairly well documented, for what it does anyway.

Feel free to send me changes and stuff

Or email me with bugs and other things
