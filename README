PACKAGE PLEB

Package Pleb is a really simple (I mean /really/ simple) package manager for Gentoo I wrote in Bash

Actually calling it a package manager is a bit unfair, it simply blindly pulls packages down and extracts them

Oh and it also does SHA1 verification on them now :D

Maybe when I stop being such a lazy shit I'll add more features

As for now it's pretty badly written (sed chaining, piping to .txt files) and lots of commented out functions

Other than that it's (I think) fairly well documented, for what it does anyway.

Feel free to send me changes and stuff

Or email me with bugs and other things
